## 3. Implementation Steps

1. NetSuite Setup
   - [x] Create and deploy general-purpose RESTlet in NetSuite
   - [ ] Set up necessary saved searches in NetSuite
   - [ ] Test RESTlet with various saved searches

2. Connection Manager Update
   - [x] Modify netsuite_connection_manager.py to work with general-purpose RESTlet
   - [ ] Implement new methods for connection management
   - [ ] Test connection manager with NetSuite

3. Streamlit Integration
   - [x] Develop 10_NetSuite_Connections.py
   - [ ] Integrate connection manager into Streamlit app
   - [ ] Implement data visualization and download features
   - [ ] Add sync status management

4. Data Synchronization
   - [ ] Implement bulk data upload functionality
   - [ ] Develop incremental update process
   - [ ] Test synchronization with various data types

5. Testing and Optimization
   - [ ] Conduct thorough testing of new components
   - [ ] Optimize performance, especially for large datasets
   - [ ] Ensure error handling and logging are comprehensive

6. Documentation Update
   - [ ] Update README.md with new functionality
   - [ ] Add inline documentation to new components
   - [ ] Create user guide for NetSuite Connections management

## 4. Considerations

- Ensure the general-purpose RESTlet is secure and handles authentication properly
- Implement appropriate access controls for the NetSuite Connections page
- Consider rate limiting and optimization for large saved searches
- Ensure all sensitive information (API keys, credentials) is stored securely

## 5. Future Enhancements

- Implement automated scheduling for NetSuite syncs
- Develop more advanced data analysis tools within the Streamlit app
- Create a dashboard for monitoring sync status and data health
- Implement bi-directional sync if required
- Add support for custom scripts or formulas in saved searches

Remember to update this plan as you progress and make decisions about the implementation. This structure allows you to integrate the NetSuite Connections functionality while maintaining your existing app structure and providing a clear roadmap for development.
