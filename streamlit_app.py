This is where you can access various modules to manage and analyze different aspects of your business, such as inventory, sales, order management, marketing, and more.

This app is actively being developed, so things will change periodically. Updates will refresh the pages, and new features will be added. To recommend new features, please email [trey.hulse@kcstorefixtures.com](mailto:trey.hulse@kcstorefixtures.com) for now.

I'll try to get a suggestion box set up or something at some point. But for now, see below for tips & tricks.
