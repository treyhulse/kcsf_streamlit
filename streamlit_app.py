This is where you can access and analyze different aspects of our business including inventory, sales, order management, reporting, and more. 

This app is actively being developed so new features will be added periodically. 

To recommend new features, please email [trey.hulse@kcstorefixtures.com](mailto:trey.hulse@kcstorefixtures.com) for now. I'll try to get a digital suggestion box set up at some point. 

For now, see below for tips & tricks.

# Add a Tips & Tricks section
st.header("Tips & Tricks")
st.write("""
- **Navigation**: Use the sidebar on the left to switch between different pages.
- **Filtering**: Utilize the filtering options within the sidebar to view specific data. (I'm working on a pre-filter so that when you view a page, it defaults to being filtered to just you.)
- **Extracting Data**: You can download CSVs for any filtered or displayed data for further analysis or to send out from the download icon in the top right of any table.
- **Searching Data**: Use the interactive search mechanism in the top right of tables to find specific order numbers, customers, ship methods, etc. Anything in the table should be searchable.
- **Data Refresh**: Most data in here has a cache mechanism setup where it is refreshed every 15-20 minutes. I can work on adding a refresh button to update the data as needed. The cache is too prevent recurring load times.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep an eye out for new features and improvements to the existing pages. If the app is rebooting, you'll get a white screen with a cake icon in the middle. This reboot takes anywhere from 10 seconds to 60 seconds.
