This app is actively being developed so new features will be added periodically. 

To recommend new features, please email [trey.hulse@kcstorefixtures.com](mailto:trey.hulse@kcstorefixtures.com) for now. I'll try to get a digital suggestion box set up at some point.

- **How To Access the Shipping Report**: Navigate to the shipping report page. In here, change the **Ship Date** selection to **"Past (including today)"** to view all orders with a ship date on or before today. You can filter to just your name as well if you are a sales rep. To see orders, open the **expandable table** at the bottom of the page. This is what would be exported and sent to you.
- **Navigation**: Use the sidebar on the left to switch between different pages. Strongly recommend bookmarking frequently visited pages.
- **Filtering**: Utilize the filtering options within the sidebar to view specific data. (I'm working on a pre-filter so that when you view a page, it defaults to being filtered to just you.)
- **Extracting Data**: You can download CSVs from any table for further use with the download icon in the top right of any table. You can also capture visualizations as images. Explore that as you wish.
- **Searching Data**: Use the interactive search mechanism in the top right of any table to find specific order numbers, customers, ship methods, etc. Anything in the table should be searchable, let me know if it's not.
- **Data Refresh**: Most data in here has a cache mechanism setup where it is refreshes every 15-20 minutes. I can work on adding a refresh button to update the data as needed. The cache is too prevent recurring load times.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep an eye out for new features and improvements to the existing pages. If the app is rebooting, you'll get a white screen with a cake icon in the middle. This reboot takes anywhere from 10 seconds to 60 seconds.
